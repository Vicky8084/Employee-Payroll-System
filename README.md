ðŸ’° Simple Java Payroll System
This is a basic Java console application that simulates a payroll system. It demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism to manage different types of employees (full-time and part-time) and calculate their salaries.

âœ¨ Features
Employee Management: Add and remove employees from the system.

Polymorphic Salary Calculation: Automatically calculates salaries for both full-time and part-time employees based on their specific rules.

Clear Employee Representation: Uses an abstract Employee class with concrete implementations for FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee.

Console Output: Displays employee details and their calculated salaries
